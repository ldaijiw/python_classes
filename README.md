# Python Classes

**O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming
4 Pillars:
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

**Class is the main factor that is used to implement any of these pillars**

**Classes are a way to bring data and functionality together**

Syntax:
```
class ClassName:
    pass
```

creating a class method
```
class ClassName:
	def method_name(self):
		pass
```
where _self_ refers to the current instance of the class

creating an instance of the class
```
inst = ClassName()
```
